**Task**

A body of mass m is accelerated along a horizontal plane and enters a vertically oriented segment of a ring (an arc) with radius R and angular size a (π/2 ≤ a ≤ 3π/2). Determine the velocity the body must have in order to pass along the entire length of the arc. Sketch the trajectory of the body after it leaves the arc. The arc has a coefficient of friction μ.
