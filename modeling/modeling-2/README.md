**Task**

An electron enters a cylindrical capacitor with an initial velocity V, midway between the plates, moving parallel to the generatrices of the cylinder. What is the minimum potential difference that must be applied to the plates so that the electron does not have time to exit the capacitor? Edge effects are to be neglected.

Plot the graphs of the following dependencies: y(x), V<sub>y</sub>(t), a<sub>y</sub>(t), y(t). The coordinate axes are directed as shown in the figure.

Calculate the flight time t and the final velocity of the electron V<sub>final</sub>.
